- Within our first project, our agency website, we made strong use of semantic HTML elements in order to improve accessibility on our page as well as code readability. The result was a site which achieved excellent accessibility scores when tested with accessibility software.

## 2. Ensure a web page is readable for screen readers

## 3. Ensure our UI has sufficient colour contrast so that everyone can perceive it comfortably

## 4. Use various tools to check that our website meets accessibility criteria

## 5. Use CSS media queries to ensure our content is always presented effectively on screens of different sizes

## 6. Demonstrate a mobile-first approach to building a website

## 7. Use CSS variables to apply repeated colours to HTML elements

## 8. Use CSS Flexbox to style children in a single-direction layout (ie a row or a column)

## 9. Use CSS Grid to style children in two-direction layout

## 10. Ensure our Git commit history tells a coherent story

## 11. Use the appropriate input types in HTML forms for gathering different types of information
